# dombot
Just a tiny helper bot for telegram capable to doing various stuff like:
- Setting reminders (pause + resume) based on region
- Fetching ID of group, channel, account
- Setting triggers and filters
- Text to speech
- ChatWars game (it is a telegram text-based MMORPG game) specific features
- And some other miscellaneous stuff which can be seen using /help command in bot

Made this bot in leisure time.
Custom requests will be happily accepted :D
